Creates a child theme with one click and lets you customise its options. 

== Description ==

The Child Theme Wizard lets you create a new child theme without the need for additional tools, right from within the WordPress admin interface. Once activated you can find it under Tools - Child Theme Wizard.

Specify a parent theme, customise options such as title and description and click Create Child Theme. Upon success you will find your new theme under Appearance - Themes.

You have the option to include GPL License Terms if you wish. The Wizard will automatically create a thumbnail too. In future versions I may include an image uploader for this feature.
